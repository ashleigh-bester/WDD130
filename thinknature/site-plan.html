        as well as child pages for each geographical area.

      <h3>Kruger National Park</h3>
      <p>
        The birth place of ThinkNature is the famous Kruger National Park.
        It is one of the largest conservation areas in South Africa and
        attracts more than one million visitors each year.
        This area is rich with wildife, including the Big Five!
        Car rides can get long for little ones, sometimes even for the adults.
        We tend to look for the obvious attractions, such as the Big Five, 
        but they aren't always reliable.
        ThinkNature provides activities that changes your perspective on what the main attraction is.
        These activities are designed to keep everyone engaged, involved and challenge your 'Beauty Fitness'.
