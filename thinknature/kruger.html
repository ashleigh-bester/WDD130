                    The birth place of ThinkNature is the famous Kruger National Park.
                    It is one of the largest conservation areas in South Africa and
                    attracts more than one million visitors each year.
                    This area is rich with wildife, including the Big Five!
                    Car rides can get long for little ones, sometimes even for the adults.
                    We tend to look for the obvious attractions, such as the Big Five, 
                    but they aren't always reliable.
                    ThinkNature provides activities that changes your perspective on what the main attraction is.
                    These activities are designed to keep everyone engaged, involved and challenge your 'Beauty Fitness'.

                    <h2>Scavenger Hunt</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of our favourite activities to do in the bush, is a Scavenger Hunt!
                        There are so many cool scavengers in the Kruger, including this Lappet-faced Vulture.
                        Now we know what you're thinking...it's not a very pretty bird.
                        In fact, you may be resisting the urge to smear sunblock all over it's bare head.
                        It's cousin (the Hooded Vulture) appears to have been waaay luckier in the gene department.
                        Bald or Hooded, we love them both! 
                        How many scavengers can you spot in the Kruger National Park? 
                        Take picures or videos and let us know via the <a class="tn_app_link" href="">ThinkNature App</a>!

                <h2>FAQs</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>Will there be a way to connect with others? If so, is it safe?</h3>
                    Yes! ThinkNature has been designed to allow you to make connections with people 
                    from around the world. You can do so by clicking the 'Beehive' button within the App itself.
                    Posted content is closely monitured (the messages in your Beehive are private), 
                    however if you find inappropriate or offensive material, please report it by sending us a "Predator Alert".
                </p>

                    <h3>Are there only certain areas where I can use the ThinkNature App?</h3>
                    Collecting the content for the challenges and competitions can be done offline 
                    as the the activities often take you into the heart of nature. 
                    Signal will not always be available, which is great for anyone looking to decrease their screen time
                    , instead forming new habits that not only promote physical but metal health as well.
                    Posts and competition entries will of course require internet access as voting takes place amongst a judges panel,
                    including gurus of conservation, nature photography and videography.
                    The ThinkNature App itself is available in most regions of the globe.
