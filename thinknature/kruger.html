                    The birth place of ThinkNature is the famous Kruger National Park.
                    It is one of the largest conservation areas in South Africa and
                    attracts more than one million visitors each year.
                    This area is rich with wildife, including the Big Five!
                    Car rides can get long for little ones, sometimes even for the adults.
                    We tend to look for the obvious attractions, such as the Big Five, 
                    but they aren't always reliable.
                    ThinkNature provides activities that changes your perspective on what the main attraction is.
                    These activities are designed to keep everyone engaged, involved and challenge your 'Beauty Fitness'.

                <h2>Scavenger Hunt</h2>
                <p>
                    One of our favourite activities to do in the bush, is a Scavenger Hunt!
                    There are so many cool scavengers in the Kruger, including this Lappet-faced Vulture.
                    Now I know what you're thinking...it's not a very pretty bird.
                    In fact, you may be resisting the urge to smear sunblock all over it's bare head.
                    It's cousin (the Hooded Vulture) appears to have been waaay luckier in the gene department.
                    Bald or Hooded, we love them both! 
                    How many scavengers can you spot in the Kruger National Park? 
                    Take picures or videos and let us know via the <a class="tn_app_link" href="">ThinkNature App</a>!
