                    Your Ecosystem is where you will find the content you create.
                    It contains your profile information such as posts, followers, votes, comments, etc.
                    It is your space to share your natural environment with people from around the world.
                    This includes wildlife, scenery, nature conservation, outdoor activities, etc.
                    It does not matter where you live. We would love to see the beauty you find in your back garden too!
                    Think 'Nature' and show us how you become 'Beauty Fit'.

                    <h2>Challenges and Competitions</h2>
                    <p>
                        As you create Your Ecosystem, you will be invited to participate in weekly challenges.
                        A video will be uploaded to ThinkNature Ecosystem at the beginning of each week,
                        explaining the challenge with an example of how it can be completed.
                        Points are earned for each challenge completed, which help your team to level up in the 'Food Chain'.
                        Keep an eye out for Big Competitions, which occur every 3 months!
                        These will help you to expand your territory and win some really cool prizes 
                        that will enhance your ThinkNature experiences.
                        During mating season this Agama (known by the locals of South Africa as the 'Bloukop Koggelmander') 
                        lizard pulls out all the stops as he competes against the other males in his small colony for territory, 
                        and females to mate with. 
                        Look at how brighly he displays his colours! Who could refuse such a handsome fellow?
                        We can't wait to see how brightly you display your colours too!
