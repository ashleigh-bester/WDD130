                <h2>Becoming Beauty Fit</h2>
                <p>
                    You may be wondering what we mean by 'Becoming Beauty Fit'.
                    Sometimes we let the beauty that we are surounded by, go unnoticed.
                    The most amazing places with stunning sights, and incredible creatures,
                    could be right on our doorstep...yet eventually, we get used to these things.
                    We spend more time inside our shells than we do digging in the dirt. 
                    We stop planning road trips, we stop exploring, and we ultimately 
                    don't ever learn how to fully absorb the opportunities for growth,
                    increased knowledge, and unreal experiences that nature presents us.
                    Becoming Beauty Fit means to be completely present, 
                    to feel, to touch, to hear, smell and even taste what the natural environment has to offer,
                    as you make memories that we guarantee, will stick with you, and help you to look
                    at the environment you find yourself in every day, with a new perspective. 
                    Take our little friend, the Leopard Tortoise, for example.

                    ThinkNature Activities are tailored to each geographical area. 
                    Travel costs such as accomodation, fuel, food, etc., have been taken into consideration as well,
                    which is why our aim is to provide affordable activities, most of which are actually free!
                    We understand that you may be just beginning on your beauty fitness journey.
                    Whether you consider yourself a fledgling (brand new at this),
                    or fully fledged (advanced - proffessional), we believe that you are capable of creating
                    an ecosystem that you are proud to share with others.
