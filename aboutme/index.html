 <p>Hi :) My name is Ashleigh. Feel free to call me Ash; most people do.</p>
    I'm currently 18, born in South Africa. I've lived next to the Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga for the last 6 years, which is ideal for someone who loves animals and nature as much as I do. I definitely believe that when we look for opportunities to appreciate Heavenly Father's creations, we become closer to Him. I have had some pretty extraordinary experiences along this adventure, one of my favourites being rehabilitating all sorts of animals from bats to bushbabies.</p>
 <p>I am an old soul with a taste for any music (mainly 60s-80s) and movies before my time. Public Speaking is one of my passions, which sometimes comes as a shock to people because I'm also fairly introverted. As far as studies are concerned; I've chosen to complete a certificate in Web and Computer Programming, while I prepare to hopefully serve a mission at the end of the year. It's not the main thing I want to study. I'm not sure about that part yet.</p>
 <p>I do know that I'd like to be a "Jackie" of all trades because as Shakespeare said, " A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."</p>
